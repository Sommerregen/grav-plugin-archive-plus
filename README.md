## About

`Archive Plus` shares many features with the [`Grav Archives plugin`](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-archives), e.g. it automatically appends a "year/month" taxonomy to all pages and provides a `plugins/archiv_plus/archive_plus.html.twig` template, which you can include in a blog sidebar to render links into a year/month/post format useful for blogs, but enhances them in an intuitive way.

Currently it

 - [x] adds a blogger like hierarchical (year/month/post) archive menu
 - [x] has (full) multi-language support **(requires Grav 0.9.33+)**
 - [x] integrates in Admin panel
 - [ ] provides a custom archive page (under development)
 - [x] and a per site configuration

See how the `Archive Plus` will look like on your site:

## Installation and Updates

Installing or updating the `Archive Plus` plugin can be done in one of two ways. Using the GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation update method (i.e. `bin/gpm install archive_plus`) or manual install by downloading [this plugin](https://github.com/sommerregen/grav-plugin-archive-plus) and extracting all plugin files to

    user/plugins/archive_plus

For more informations, please check the [Installation and update guide](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Usage

The `Archive Plus` plugin comes with some sensible default configuration, that are pretty self explanatory:

### Config Defaults

```yaml
# Global plugin configurations

enabled: true                 # Set to false to disable this plugin completely
built_in_css: true            # Use built-in CSS of the plugin

# Global and page specific configurations

show:
  counter: true               # Toggle to show number of items before the link
  year: true                  # Toggle to show year
  month: true                 # Toggle to show month
  items: true                 # Toggle to show items

limit:
  year: 2                     # Limit to show only the last n years
  month: 12                   # Limit to show only the last n months
  items: 40                   # Limit to show only the last n items

order:
  by: date                    # Ordering of items
  dir: desc                   # Ordering of items (asc or desc)

filter_combinator: and        # The filter combinator to use to combine several filters
filters:                      # Filter to select which items should be shown
  category: blog
```

If you need to change any value, then the best process is to copy the [archive_plus.yaml](archive_plus.yaml) file into your `users/config/plugins/` folder (create it if it doesn't exist), and then modify there. This will override the default settings.

### Template Override

Something you might want to do is to override the look and feel of the archives, and with Grav it is super easy.

Copy the template file [templates/plugins/archiv_plus/archive_plus.html.twig](templates/plugins/archiv_plus/archive_plus.html.twig) into the `templates/partials` folder of your custom theme, and that is it.

    user/themes/custom-theme/templates/plugins/archiv_plus/archive_plus.html.twig

You can now edit the override and tweak it however you prefer.

> **Note:** Don't touch or edit the template file [templates/plugins/archiv_plus/archives.html.twig](templates/plugins/archiv_plus/archives.html.twig) in the `templates/partials` folder! This file serves as a compatibility fallback for those themes which expect the Archives plugin to be installed.
